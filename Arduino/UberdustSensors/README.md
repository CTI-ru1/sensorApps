### UberdustSensors



* `RandomSensor` an easy to use Sensor that provides random integer values that can be used for testing during the initial development of a CoAP application. Random values are generated using the Arduino `rand()` function and a limit number used to limit the generated numbers by `rand()%limit`  
* `ParentSensor` a Sensor device used to provide debugging information to the developers for routing information used to propagate the information to the gateway devices.
